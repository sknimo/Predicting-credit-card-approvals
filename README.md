## Introduction

>Several factors comes into play before a credit application is approved or rejected. That notwithstanding we all need credit at one point or another, especially when it comes to financing  capital intensive projects. This project analyzes the factors that could affect a credit card application.


The dataset contains information about credit card applications, for identity protection purposes, it has the name of the features removed. That is to say we have no idea what those columns represents, where the data was collected or who are the participants. We will therefore make several educated guesses.

The nature of the dataset makes it very suitable for investigative analytics and predictive modeling. So we will be training a machine learning model with it.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/predicting-credit-card-approvals/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)

### Project structure

* All analysis where done in the jupyter notebook called _predicting-credit-card-approval.ipynb_. 

## Analysis
The analysis done covers:

1. loading and cleaning of the data
2. Exploratory data analysis
    1. for numerical features
    2. for categorical features
3. Fitting a machine learning model
    1. preprocessing steps
    2. prediction

### Results
The machine learning model built was able to predict the decision of given or rejecting a credit card application with 88% accuracy.

## How to use the program
* you can download the jupyter-notebook and run it on your local machine
* open it from the repository and on the first page there is a "Kaggle" icon, when you click on that icon it would send you to kaggle where you can edit it.

## Requirements
* Python
* Jupyter-notebook
